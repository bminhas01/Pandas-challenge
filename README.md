This report analysis student performance data and other key metrics to gain insight into school outcomes across the district. More specifically, the goal of this analysis is to present recommendations based on an analysis of district-wide standardized test results. The analysis itself is presented in different summary tables, each with its own area of focus. 

1) The District Summary presents a high level snapshot of performance across the district. Included within it are the following:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * Percentage of Students Passing Math (% Passing Math)
  * Percentage of Students Passing Reading (% Passing Reading)
  * Percentage of Students Passing Math and Reading (% Overall Reading)


2) The School Summary presents key metrics for each school within the district. Included within it are the following:
  * School Name
  * Whether the school is a District School or a Charter School (School Type)
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * Percentage of Students Passing Math (% Passing Math)
  * Percentage of Students Passing Reading (% Passing Reading)
  * Percentage of Students Passing Math and Reading (% Overall Reading)


3) The Top Performing Schools and the Bottom Performing Schools tables each present a snapshot of 5 schools with the highest and lowest percentage of students passing BOTH math and reading (% Overall Passing), respectively. The tables also include key metrics included in the School Summary table. 


4) The Math Scores by Grade and Reading Scores by Grade tables each list the average Math and Reading standardized test score, respectively. Furthermore, the scores are divided into grades (9th - 12th) at each school. 


5) The Scores by School Spending breaks down school performance based on average spending per student. This is to account for the variations in school size across the district. This table also includes additional key metrics pertaining to student performance:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * Percentage of Students Passing Math (% Passing Math)
  * Percentage of Students Passing Reading (% Passing Reading)
  * Percentage of Students Passing Math and Reading (% Overall Reading)


6) The Scores by School Size breaks down school performance based on the approximate size of the student body (small, medium, large). The table also includes the key metrics present in the Scores by School Spending table. 


7) The Scores by School Type presents a unique view of student performance based on the type of school (District or Charter) they attend. The table includes the same key metrics as the Scores by School Size and School Spending tables.
